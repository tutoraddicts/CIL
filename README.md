# Simple Interpreter

A simple Interpreter I don't know Why I am actually doing this :/

## How to use this 

	1. Fork the repository.
	2. Build the project with ./build(only for Linux) script

### Test: 

    1. Open command promt or terminal run the command ./ec example.ec
    2. filename will be the name of your text file


## What can you do right now ?

    1. You can print any string in console
        Syntax -> say "string" (/n to add next line and /t for tab)
    2. You can create variables Sadly for now everything you create is string because I am dumb :(
        Syntax -> Var_name = Value 
    3. You can Print Variables too
        Syntax -> say var_name
        Syntax -> say "My variable" +var_name+ " Working"
        Syntax -> say "My Variable" var_name " Working"
    
Thanks for look over the repo :) Have a nice day ::heart::
