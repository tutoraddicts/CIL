# Simple Interpreter

A simple Interpreter I don't know Why I am actually doing this :/

## How to use this 

	1. Clone the repository.
	2. Build the project with ./build(only for Linux) script

### Test: 

    1. Open command prompt or terminal run the command ./ec filename.ec
    2. filename will be the name of your text file
 
### CLI :
    1. Open CMD/Terminal run ./ec


## What is the Progress ?

    1. How to Create Variables :(
        Var1 = Value (data type will be automatically detected during initialisation)
        Var2 = Var1

    2. How To Print in console
        say "Variable Data " Var1 " transfered to new Variable Var2\n" (\n to add next line and \t for tab)
        say "Variable Data "+Var1+" transfered to new Variable Var2\n" (This is another way to write thiings > using +)
    3. How to get input from user
        get var1
